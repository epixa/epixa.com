  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    I work on open source software at <a href="https://www.elastic.co">Elastic</a>,
    write a bunch of JavaScript, actually enjoy Elixir, and can be pretentious
    about coffee. My entire career has been built upon open source technology,
    so this blog is one way to give back.
