title: About Court Ewing

# I am Court Ewing, and I occasionally write software.

Organizer of [Pub Standards Lancaster](http://www.pubstandards.us).
Volunteer for [Coder Dojo Lancaster](http://codelancaster.org).

I was first introduced to programming when I stumbled upon PHP in 1998, and I was hooked ever since.  My first
contract project was in 1999, and I am horrified to say that it is still online today
([in all of its frameset/mspaint goodness](http://haasvalue.com)).

Between then and now, I earned my B.S. in Computer Science,
worked at a great [design agency](http://mododesigngroup.com) out of Pennsylvania,
a startup-oriented [software shop](http://echolibre.com/index.php) out of Dublin,
a pioneer [Platform as a service](https://engineyard.com) out of San Francisco,
and a bleeding-edge [search startup](https://www.elastic.co) that makes money
building open source software (seriously, that's a real thing).

I am powered by coffee, beer, and a seriously weird music collection.
